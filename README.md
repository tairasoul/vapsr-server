# vapsr-server

that's right, vap speedrun 1v1s are (almost) here motherfuckers

this is the server.

port it runs on is 7777, i have yet to add a way to change that

client is not open source as of now as theres still issues with it and i want it to be publicly functional (private rooms) so you don't have to find random players every time and hope you get in a match with a friend

runs on dotnet 6.0

will be switching to binary serialization soon
