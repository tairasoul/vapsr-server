# vapsr-server

that's right, vap speedrun 1v1s are (almost) here motherfuckers

please expect issues as this is my first time working with networking at this level

this is the server, use alongside [vapsr-client](https://github.com/tairasoul/vapsr-client)

default port is 7777, set environment variable VAPSR_SERVER_PORT to change it.

most logging is disabled by default, set environment variable VAPSR_DEBUG to 1 to enable.

runs on dotnet 8.0
