# vapsr-server

that's right, vap speedrun 1v1s are (almost) here motherfuckers

this is the server.

default port is 7777, set environment variable VAPSR_SERVER_PORT to change it

client is not open source as of now as theres still issues with it and i want it to be publicly functional (private rooms) so you don't have to find random players every time and hope you get in a match with a friend

runs on dotnet 6.0
